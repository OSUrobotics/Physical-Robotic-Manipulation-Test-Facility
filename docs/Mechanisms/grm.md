# Grasp Reset Mechanism

<img src="grasp_reset.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

The Grasp Reset Mechanism (GRM) resets an object to a home position and a variable orientation. It also swaps between objects, collects data, and interfaces with a variety of manipulators. The GRM was designed to enable large scale grasping trials --- whether for benchmarking, testing, training learning models, or generating datasets.

The following sections will provide detailed documentaion about the mechanism and its software.
